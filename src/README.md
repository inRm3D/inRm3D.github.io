# Some additional things.

install https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazarus-gtk2

then `lazbuild -B inRm3D.lpi`

currrent bug:

1. ~~all the text become || ||| , maybe bmp is the problem.~~ thanks for GPT-5.2-Codex xhigh
2. ~~the shortcut is conflict with input box, e.g. type `i`.~~ thanks for GPT-5.2-Codex xhigh
3. Property\_P is too narrow.

Thanks for gpt5-codex-high for porting this old codebase.

Use Delphi 7 to build.

Now is migrating to Delphi 11, with embarcadero.

All right reserved. Old code is just for display.
